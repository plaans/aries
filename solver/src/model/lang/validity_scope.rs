/// Represents the scope in which a given expression is valid.
///
/// It is composed of:
/// - `required_presence`: the set of presence literals of all variables that appear in the expression
/// - `guards`: a set of literals such that if one of them is true, the expression is defined.  
///
/// # Example (no guards)
///
/// Consider the expression `a <= b`, where `a` and `b` are optional variable.
/// The value of the expression can only be computed when both `a` and `b` are present,
/// that is when `presence(a) & presence(b)` holds.
///
/// For this example, the scope should be:
/// `ValidityScope = { required_presence: [presence(a), presence(b)], guards = [] }`
///
/// # Example (with guards)
///
/// In some cases however, it might be the case that an expression is valid even when some of
/// its parts are not.
/// For instance, consider the expression `!presence(a) | (a <= 2)`.
/// If `!presence(a)` holds, then the expression evaluates to true regardless of the value of
/// of `(a <= 2)` and in particular when it is undefined due the absence of `a`.
///
/// For this example, the scope should be:
/// `ValidityScope = { required_presence: [presence(a)], guards = [!presence(a)] }`
///
/// # Flattening to a conjunction of literals
///
/// The [`ValidityScope::flatten`] method allows transforming a `ValidityScope` into a conjunction
/// of literals that must hold for the expression to be defined.
