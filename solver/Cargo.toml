[features]
# If enabled, will instruct the the solver to count cpu cycles at various point of its execution.
# The implementation relies to time-stamp counter and intrinsic for the x86_64 platform.
# If the target platform is not supported, activating this feature will have no effects.
cpu_cycles = []


# If enabled, use i64 for integer constants and i128 for long constants.
# If "i64" is enabled then "i128" must be disabled.
