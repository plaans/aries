[features]

# if enabled, solver and theory statistics may be exported and imported using serde
export_stats = [ "dep:serde", "serde/serde_derive" ]

# If enabled, will instruct the the solver to count cpu cycles at various point of its execution.
# The implementation relies to time-stamp counter and intrinsic for the x86_64 platform.
# If the target platform is not supported, activating this feature will have no effects.
